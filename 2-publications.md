      Analysis and Design of Algorithms: Find and Replace feature using Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm</a><br>
      As the name suggests, I implemented "find and replace" feature, one of the mostly used feature in any text editor using Knuth Morris Pratt algorithm. Knuth Morris Pratt is a string searching algorithm which searches for a given string within a text based on mismatch occurence. It's the first linear time string searching algorithm. 
      Implemented in C.<br><i>Dec 2016</i>.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/darshilpk3/Undergrad-Open-Ended-Problems/tree/master/AlgorithmsOEP">code</a>]</span>

      Computer Graphics: A simple 3 lane car racing game.</a><br>
      Developed a simple car racing game in C using the basics of Computer Graphics. The player gets 3 life to progress through levels and complete the whole track. The speed increases while progressing through each level by minimizing the delay of a car reappearing. A simple twist has also been included by adding a story to this simple game.<br><i>Mar 2016</i>.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/darshilpk3/Undergrad-Open-Ended-Problems/tree/master/ComputerGraphicsOEP">code</a>]</span>

      Web Technology: Food Ordering Website</a><br>
      This project demonstrates a simple food ordering website implemented using HTML, CSS and PHP. For maintaining the users and their orders and carts, I have used MySql as a database.<br><i>Jan 2016</i>.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/darshilpk3/Undergrad-Open-Ended-Problems/tree/master/WebTechnologyOEP">code</a>]</span>
