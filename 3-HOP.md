      Home On Phone: Adding value to your home</a><br>
      The goal of this project was to encourage the government’s initiative to make the city smarter. This project includes some very useful features which can be used in day to day life and which were selected after observing the difficulties that we face in our daily life. Along with making the homes smarter, this project also focuses on conserving the energy viz. Electrical Energy. Another remarkable thing was that the investment needed to bring the control of your home to the phone was made very cheaper with this project. This project includes various features/modules which focuses on areas like Enhanced Security, Energy Conservation, Easy control to home appliances etc. These features are divided into various modules like:
        Module – I: Security through Geo-Fencing
        In this module, we'll alert the user as soon as someone enters the room (which should not be
        compromised) along with the photo of the person entering and without making the person entering
        know about it. In this module, we will try to data fence a certain area using <b>OpenCV</b>.<br>
        Module – II: Light Watch
        In this module, we are going to adjust the intensity of the bulb/tube light/LEDs in a room according
        to the amount of sunlight entering that room and we are also going to have a manual mode in
        which the user can manually change the intensity of bulb/light.<br>
        Module – III: Ambience Assistant
        In this module, whenever a person enters his home and is connected by the HOME WIFI the
        desired home appliances will turn on according to the settings done by the user in his android
        application.<br>
        Module – IV: Mail Notifier
        In this module, the user will be notified as soon as any person posts the mail in the mail box.<br>
        Module-V: Android Application
        In this module, we are going to make an android application which will be integration of all the
        modules and through this application all the home appliances can be controlled by the user.<br>
    Programming Language used to make NodeMCU, Sensors and Android Application communicate between each other is Lua.
