      Senior Year Project: Home On Phone - Adding value to your home</a><br>
      The goal of this project was to encourage the government’s initiative to make the city smarter. This project includes some very useful features which can be used in day to day life and which were selected after observing the difficulties that we face in our daily life. Along with making the homes smarter, this project also focuses on conserving the energy viz. Electrical Energy. Another remarkable thing was that the investment needed to bring the control of your home to the phone was made very cheaper with this project. This project includes various features/modules which focuses on areas like Enhanced Security, Energy Conservation, Easy control to home appliances etc. These features are divided into various modules like:<br>
        <b>Module – I: Security through Geo-Fencing</b><br>
        In this module, we'll alert the user as soon as someone enters the room (which should not be
        compromised) along with the photo of the person entering and without making the person entering
        know about it. In this module, we will try to data fence a certain area using <b>OpenCV</b>.<br>
        <b>Module – II: Light Watch</b><br>
        In this module, we are going to adjust the intensity of the bulb/tube light/LEDs in a room according
        to the amount of sunlight entering that room and we are also going to have a manual mode in
        which the user can manually change the intensity of bulb/light.<br>
        <b>Module – III: Ambience Assistant</b><br>
        In this module, whenever a person enters his home and is connected by the HOME WIFI the
        desired home appliances will turn on according to the settings done by the user in his android
        application.<br>
        <b>Module – IV: Mail Notifier</b><br>
        In this module, the user will be notified as soon as any person posts the mail in the mail box.<br>
        <b>Module-V: Android Application</b><br>
        In this module, we are going to make an android application which will be integration of all the
        modules and through this application all the home appliances can be controlled by the user.<br>
    Programming Language used to make NodeMCU, Sensors and Android Application communicate between each other is Lua.

      Internship: Smart Pole using NodeJS, Express, Mongo and jQuery</a><br>
      This project was carried out during my internship in R.K Infratel. This was a proof of concept to implement a smart traffic pole which connects to different sensors like temperature sensor, wind temperature, water level temeprature to name a few. The sensors used were of iMonnit which displays the information/reading on the Smart-Pole web services created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.<br>
      Developed a RestAPI using NodeJS and Express which is used by the web service to communicate to the backend to get the sensor readings. To store the sensors' data and users' information, database used is MongoDB as it supports high replication of data and unstructured data as well.<br>
      Along with this, to represent the data effectively we have used heat maps which shows which region/s have high temperature at that current time. To track the data of each sensor for data mining purpose, we used ChartJS to represent those mined information which can show, for and example, which region is being experiencing the highest and the lowest temperature in the past months/years.
