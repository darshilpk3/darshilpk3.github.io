				src="/assets/img/profile.jpg"> I am a Master's student at the San Jose State University,
			studying Software Engineering with concentration in Enterprise Software Technologies and Data Science. I
			will be graduating in the year of 2020 and currently seeking for an internship opportunity in the related
			field where I can enhance the knowledge of technologies and put to practice whatever I have learnt during my
			graduate studies</p>
		<p> Talking about this field, since the invention of mobile phones and portable desktops, I was quite intrigued
			by what these small machines
			could do to help us in our day to day life, especially those Smart Voice Assistants which are getting
			smarter since 2008. This motivated me to choose this field for my further education as I wanted to
			contribute to the growth of this field. With this motivation, I started my journey with Bachelor’s degree in
			Computer Engineering and now continuing the journey with Master's degree in Software Engineering to achieve
			what I initially strived for.
			I am especially proud of my Senior Year Project which was titled: “Home on Phone: Adding Value to Your
			Home”.
			In this IOT based project, the key challenge was to design smart products that could improve the quality of
			our daily life and
			make our homes smarter. The icing on the cake for me was when we won the First Prize for our efforts in the
			prestigious Projects Showcase Competition held by the Computer Society of India – an achievement that makes
			me proud till this day.
			In addition to my academic endeavors I have always strived to gain practical knowledge whenever possible. A
			case in point is my three months internship at the <b>R.K. Infratel</b> Company between May-July 2017. As
			the
			leader of the four-person team that worked on this project I learnt how to organize and delegate
			responsibilities effectively among my team members as per their individual capabilities and more importantly
			how to work and lead the team seamlessly as part of a team. This internship also gave me an opportunity to
			learn new
			tools like Node.JS and MongoDB in addition to enhancing my working knowledge of programs like Express,
			Google-Map APIs and JWT Tokens.
			After completing that project, I took another step towards my goal by securing an Internship in <b>Deep
				Technologies</b> from Nov 2017 - May 2018.
			With these projects and experiences, that I have had throughout my journey, hold me in good stead to
			contribute even more to this field and learning along with it. </p>
		<p> Fast Forwarding, now being a master's student I have worked with MERN Stack extensively by implementing
			prototypes of popular applications like HomeAway and LinkedIn. There are many more projects that I have
			done. For full portfolio, reports and code follow
			the Projects tab above. </p>
		<p>I am particularly interested in Exploring more towards this Full Stack Development by integrating it with
			Data Science, since the power of Data Science is something we all know about and has been talked about at
			various places. For full profile check out my linkedIn at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darshilpkapadia/">Darshil Kapadia</a>.
