I have started working on developing a hackathon management system using Spring Framework as a project to be carried out under the course <a href="http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE275.html">Enterprise Application Development</a>. We'll be working to make use of various Spring modules like AOP, Data Access, IOC, MVC and many more.
