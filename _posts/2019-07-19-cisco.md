We are working on providing solution to the most common client request i.e configuration help. As per the cisco's study, more than 70% issues raised by the customers can easily be solved by configuring or reconfiguring the devices they have complaints about. Hence, we are providing a platform where the users have to register their devices and the application will configure the whole device when any user raises an issue on any registered device and thus automating the issue solving process without man-power.
