Starting to work on developing my own database system which can run in 2 modes and they are 1) Available-Partition Tolerant(AP) Mode and 2) Consistent-Partition Tolerant(CP) Mode. Going to use Java language and will be dockerizing it to simulate the environment of multiple nodes running the same java code.
